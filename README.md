# 🚀 Day 20 – Excel Export Dashboard with Data Preprocessing

Exporting structured data isn’t fluff — it’s a feature that lives inside HR tools, analytics dashboards, and finance platforms. On Day 20, I built a React-based system that renders a dynamic table and converts it into a cleaned, readable XLSX file.

---

## 🔧 What I built
- Table rendering: employee data (name, salary, role, status)  
- Client-side sorting by salary or role  
- Cleanup logic: remove inactive or empty rows  
- Header mapping: internal keys ➝ readable labels  
- Export trigger using SheetJS (xlsx)  
- Timestamped filename like employees_export_02-Aug-2025.xlsx  
- Toast feedback on successful download

---

## 🧠 Why this matters
Exporting is part of real workflows:

- Internal teams need offline audit logs  
- Finance teams need shareable salary reports  
- HR needs to archive filtered employee lists  
- Dashboards become usable when data isn’t locked in the UI

This project taught me how to *turn UI into a shareable deliverable* — from preprocessing, header logic, and sheet generation to download feedback.

---

## ⚙ Stack & Concepts
- *React.js* — Hooks, JSX table structure  
- *SheetJS (xlsx)* — XLSX file export  
- *Tailwind CSS* — minimal responsive layout  
- *JavaScript sorting & data mutation*

> ✅ Day 20 locked. My UI doesn't just render — it delivers exports with meaning.
